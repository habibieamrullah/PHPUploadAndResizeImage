# PHPUploadAndResizeImage
Upload and resize image with PHP before storing in upload folder in our server

We can not allow users to upload any files and any images to our server, we need to make rule, for example we don't allow them to upload an image bigger than 1mb/2mb or image that its width is more than 512px.

Here with this script we can prevent users to upload excessive big files and images. So before we store their image in our server, we compress them to an appropriate size.
